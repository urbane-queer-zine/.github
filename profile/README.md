# What is this?

I'm not 100% sure yet. I posted the following idea on mastodon:
"Something like Cosmopolitan, but for trans feminine folks in our 40s who don't want to wear clothing from Chico's and 
coming from more of an "eat the rich" stance.

I want a fashion magazine that doesn't make me immediately feel like shit. 

Come to think of it, a more diverse fashion/lifestyle mag would be a good thing in general."

So that's the working idea, but can use more refinement. Accepting images, photoshoots, prose,
and anything else that fits the general sentiment above. Not sure yet about distribution,
but with this being a public repo, the work is visible as it's being worked on and before
any kind of refinement / distribution -- which I kinda like, tbh.

# Why github?

Whenever I'm starting a project, I think about how to gather ideas and 
submit them, and github is a great tool for something like that. There 
are other zines that have been coordinated with github. 
(Tilde Town's zine used to be run that way -- see https://tilde.town/~zine/)

It's public, it's easy to add contributors, it's got built in facilities for review
and acceptance of work. It emphasizes and correctly attributes ownership,
which I think is important.

# Why not github?

It creates barriers to access for non-techie folks. I'm chewing on a way to 
get contributions another way.
